        <h1>The Rich History of Cricket</h1> 
         <h2>
        17th Century
    </h2>
    <p>
        Cricket is a sport with a long and fascinating history that spans over several centuries. The origins of cricket can be traced back to 16th-century England, where it was initially played by shepherds and other rural communities. The game was played using rudimentary equipment, such as a stick or a crook for a bat and a woolen ball.
        <br>
        Over time, cricket evolved and became popular among the upper classes, who played it in their estates and gardens. The sport gained formal recognition in the 18th century, and the first known cricket match was played in 1709 between teams from Kent and London.
        <br>
        In 1744, the first known laws of cricket were established, which were known as the Laws of Cricket. These laws were updated and revised over the years and formed the basis for the modern rules of the sport.

        In 1787, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded, which is still the world's most influential cricket club. The MCC is responsible for maintaining and updating the Laws of Cricket, and it has been instrumental in the development of the sport.

        During the 19th century, cricket continued to grow in popularity, and the first international cricket match was played in 1844 between Canada and the United States. In 1868, the first-ever cricket tour was undertaken by an English team to Australia, which marked the beginning of international cricket tours.
        <br>
        The first international cricket match between England and Australia was played in 1877, which led to the establishment of the Ashes, a test series played between the two countries. The Ashes is one of the oldest and most prestigious test series in cricket and is still played today.
